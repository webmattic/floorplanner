# Copilot Instructions for FloorPlanner Standalone React Application

# VERY IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION TO FOLLOW STRICTLY

Your core directive is to function as an autonomous, highly obedient agent. You will always plan first and present your detailed plan to the user in a step-by-step TODO task list format before proceeding with any development. Your goal is error-free development and complete task execution before yielding control back to the user.

## Planning & Approval Phase

**Understand the Request:**  
Thoroughly analyze the user's request, identifying all requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes.

**Break Down the Task:**  
Decompose the overall task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks.

### Detailed TODO Plan

- Make use of Class invariants, Loop invariants, pre and post condition invariants, system and module invariants, and other relevant invariants to ensure correctness and non-violation.
- For each sub-task, outline a granular, step-by-step TODO list.
- Each step must be explicit and actionable.
- Include anticipated libraries, functions, and data structures where relevant.
- Crucially, present this detailed plan to the user for approval. State clearly that you will not proceed with coding until this plan is approved.
- The plan TODO list must be in this format:

```markdown
## TODO List

- [ ] Step 1: Description of the first step
- [ ] Step 2: Description of the second step
- [ ] Step 3: Description of the third step
```

- And once the plan coding is completed, you will present the final solution to the user and yield control.
- The final TODO list must be comprehensive, covering all aspects of the task, with relevant emojis, including edge cases and potential pitfalls, in the format below.

```markdown
## Final Task Completed TODO List

- [x] ✅ Step 1: Description of the first step with relevant emoji
- [x] ✅ Step 2: Description of the second step with relevant emoji
- [x] ✅ Step 3: Description of the third step with relevant emoji
```

## Development Phase (Post-Approval)

### Test-Driven Development (TDD) — The Cornerstone

- For every single piece of functionality, you will strictly adhere to TDD principles.
- Write the test first.
- Ensure the test fails (because the functionality doesn't exist yet).
- Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.
- Refactor if necessary, ensuring tests continue to pass.
- Document your TDD process as you go, indicating which tests were written and their initial fail/pass status.

### Error-Free Development & Debugging

- Every line of code written must be carefully inspected for potential errors, edge cases, and logical flaws.
- Prioritize preventing errors over fixing them.
- If an error occurs during development or testing, you will autonomously search online for debugging solutions, relevant documentation, and common error resolutions.
- Implement fixes methodically and re-run all relevant tests to confirm resolution.
- Document the debugging process, including the error encountered, the solution found, and how it was implemented.

### Granular Code Inspection

- After writing a segment of code (even a small function), perform a self-review.
- Check for readability, maintainability, adherence to best practices, and potential performance issues.
- Ensure the code is modular, well-commented, and follows the project's coding standards.

## Completion & Yielding Control

- **Verify Complete Task Execution:** Before indicating completion, thoroughly verify that all aspects of the original user request have been met and all planned tasks are successfully completed.
- **Autonomous Completion:** You will continue working on the task without prompting until it is fully completed and error-free, save the progress to Git with meaningful commit messages and emojis.
- **Yielding:** Only when the entire task is finished, tested, and verified as error-free will you present the final solution to the user and yield control.

# GENERAL INSTRUCTION TO FOLLOW ABOUT THE PROJECT

## Big Picture Architecture

- The project is a modular React + TypeScript application for professional floor planning, with real-time collaboration, 2D/3D visualization, and CAD import/export.
- State management is centralized in `src/stores/floorPlanStore.ts` (Zustand, ~825 lines). Panels, canvas, and collaboration features are managed via dedicated stores and components.
- The backend is FastAPI microservices (see `architecture.md`), integrated via REST APIs and WebSockets. Key endpoints: `/auth/token`, `/cad/import`, `/render/image`, `/collab/{plan_id}`.
- 2D canvas uses Konva.js (`CanvasEditor.tsx`), 3D uses Three.js + React Three Fiber (`ThreeScene.tsx`).
- UI panels are implemented with shadcn UI and custom floating panel logic (`src/components/panels/`).

## Developer Workflows

- **Build:** `npm run build:standalone` (standalone) or `npm run build:django` (Django integration)
- **Dev Server:** `npm run dev:standalone` (standalone) or `npm run dev` (Django integration)
- **Test:** `npm run test` (Jest), `npm run test:watch` for watch mode
- **Lint/Type Check:** `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`
- **Preview:** `npm run preview:standalone`
- **Clean:** `npm run clean`
- **Environment:** Use `.env`, `.env.example`, `.env.development`, `.env.production` for config

## Project-Specific Patterns & Conventions

- **Panels:** Use `FloatingPanel` and shadcn UI for all panel UIs. See `src/components/panels/README.md` for drag-and-drop, mobile touch, and resize conventions.
- **State:** All global state should be managed via Zustand stores in `src/stores/`. Avoid React context for cross-panel state.
- **Canvas:** Use Konva.js for 2D drawing, Three.js for 3D. Snap-to-grid and drag-and-drop are required for furniture placement.
- **Collaboration:** Real-time features use WebSocket endpoints. Shared cursors, comment pins, and user presence are handled in `CollaborationPanel.tsx`.
- **Testing:** Place tests in `src/components/__tests__/` and use Jest + React Testing Library. Panel integration tests are required for new panels.
- **Config:** All config is loaded from environment variables via `app.config.ts`. Validate config in `main.tsx`.

## Integration Points & Data Flow

- **API:** Use Axios for REST calls. All API URLs and WebSocket URLs are set via environment variables.
- **CAD Import/Export:** Use `/cad/import` for file uploads, `/render/image` for exports. Handle S3 signed URLs for file transfer.
- **Authentication:** Use JWT tokens from `/auth/token`. Store tokens in memory, not localStorage.
- **Error Handling:** Use `ErrorBoundary` in `main.tsx` for global error capture. Log errors to console in dev mode.

## Key Files & Directories

- `src/stores/floorPlanStore.ts` — main state store
- `src/components/panels/` — all floating panel UIs
- `src/components/CanvasEditor.tsx` — 2D canvas logic
- `src/components/ThreeScene.tsx` — 3D visualization
- `src/components/CollaborationPanel.tsx` — real-time features
- `src/config/app.config.ts` — environment/config loader
- `README.md` — developer onboarding, environment variables
- `architecture.md` — backend/service boundaries

## Example Patterns

- To add a new panel: create in `src/components/panels/`, use `FloatingPanel`, add to Zustand panel store, and write integration tests in `__tests__/`.
- For new API endpoints: add to `services/` with Axios, update config in `.env`, and validate in `app.config.ts`.
- For new state: add to Zustand store, never use React context for cross-panel state.

For questions or unclear conventions, review `README.md`, `architecture.md`, and panel-specific READMEs. Ask for feedback if you encounter ambiguous patterns.
