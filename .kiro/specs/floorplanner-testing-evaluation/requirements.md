# FloorPlanner Application Testing and Evaluation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the comprehensive testing, debugging, and evaluation requirements for the FloorPlanner application. The goal is to identify and fix all TypeScript errors, lint issues, component integration problems, and provide a thorough assessment of the application's robustness, code quality, modularity, and scalability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: TypeScript Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved so that the application can build successfully and maintain type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run type-check` THEN the system SHALL return zero TypeScript errors
2. WHEN importing components THEN the system SHALL have proper type definitions for all imports
3. WHEN using Vite environment variables THEN the system SHALL have proper type declarations
4. WHEN accessing store properties THEN the system SHALL have consistent type interfaces
5. WHEN using UI components THEN the system SHALL have proper prop type definitions

### Requirement 2: Component Integration Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all components to interface correctly with each other so that the application functions as intended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components import from stores THEN the system SHALL use consistent data structures
2. WHEN components pass props THEN the system SHALL validate prop types match expectations
3. WHEN components use shared utilities THEN the system SHALL have consistent function signatures
4. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL not have missing dependencies or circular imports
5. WHEN components interact THEN the system SHALL maintain proper state synchronization

### Requirement 3: Duplicate Code Elimination

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate code and content removed so that the codebase is maintainable and follows DRY principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate duplicate implementations
2. WHEN reviewing utility functions THEN the system SHALL merge redundant helper functions
3. WHEN examining type definitions THEN the system SHALL unify duplicate interfaces
4. WHEN checking imports THEN the system SHALL remove unused import statements
5. WHEN validating components THEN the system SHALL eliminate redundant component definitions

### Requirement 4: Application Functionality Testing

**User Story:** As a user, I want the FloorPlanner application to load and display content correctly so that I can use all intended features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL load without runtime errors
2. WHEN rendering the main interface THEN the system SHALL display all UI panels correctly
3. WHEN interacting with tools THEN the system SHALL respond to user input appropriately
4. WHEN switching between 2D and 3D views THEN the system SHALL render content properly
5. WHEN using drawing tools THEN the system SHALL create and manipulate floor plan elements
6. WHEN accessing floating panels THEN the system SHALL show/hide panels without errors

### Requirement 5: Critical Component Fixes

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the problematic components (LayersPanel.tsx, PropertiesPanel.tsx) fixed so that they function correctly within the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using PropertiesPanel THEN the system SHALL display selected element properties correctly
2. WHEN using LayersPanel THEN the system SHALL manage layer visibility and organization
3. WHEN components access store data THEN the system SHALL handle missing or undefined data gracefully
4. WHEN components render forms THEN the system SHALL validate input types and handle changes
5. WHEN components use UI libraries THEN the system SHALL import and use components correctly

### Requirement 6: Build and Runtime Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully and run without errors so that it can be deployed and used.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build:standalone` THEN the system SHALL complete without errors
2. WHEN running `npm run dev:standalone` THEN the system SHALL start the development server successfully
3. WHEN loading the application in browser THEN the system SHALL render without console errors
4. WHEN interacting with the application THEN the system SHALL not throw runtime exceptions
5. WHEN using application features THEN the system SHALL maintain stable performance

### Requirement 7: Code Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a stakeholder, I want a comprehensive evaluation of the application's code quality so that I can understand its maintainability and scalability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating robustness THEN the system SHALL be assessed on error handling, edge cases, and stability
2. WHEN evaluating code quality THEN the system SHALL be assessed on TypeScript usage, best practices, and consistency
3. WHEN evaluating modularity THEN the system SHALL be assessed on component separation, reusability, and coupling
4. WHEN evaluating scalability THEN the system SHALL be assessed on architecture, performance, and extensibility
5. WHEN providing final rating THEN the system SHALL give scores from 1-10 for each category with detailed justification

### Requirement 8: Lint Error Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all linting errors resolved so that the code follows consistent style guidelines and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run lint` THEN the system SHALL return zero linting errors
2. WHEN checking unused variables THEN the system SHALL remove or mark as intentionally unused
3. WHEN validating imports THEN the system SHALL remove unused imports and fix import paths
4. WHEN checking code style THEN the system SHALL follow consistent formatting rules
5. WHEN validating TypeScript usage THEN the system SHALL use proper type annotations

### Requirement 9: Missing Dependencies Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing dependencies identified and resolved so that the application has all required packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing imports THEN the system SHALL identify missing npm packages
2. WHEN checking UI components THEN the system SHALL ensure all required UI libraries are installed
3. WHEN validating Three.js usage THEN the system SHALL have proper Three.js type definitions
4. WHEN checking testing dependencies THEN the system SHALL have all required test packages
5. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL not fail due to missing dependencies

### Requirement 10: Performance and Architecture Evaluation

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want an assessment of the application's performance and architecture so that I can plan future improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating component architecture THEN the system SHALL assess separation of concerns and component hierarchy
2. WHEN evaluating state management THEN the system SHALL assess Zustand store organization and data flow
3. WHEN evaluating rendering performance THEN the system SHALL assess Canvas/Three.js integration efficiency
4. WHEN evaluating bundle size THEN the system SHALL assess code splitting and optimization opportunities
5. WHEN evaluating maintainability THEN the system SHALL assess code organization and documentation quality
