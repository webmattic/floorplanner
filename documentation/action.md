## Current Status

- ✅ All codebase files have been scanned and cleaned.
- ✅ Robust selectors (`data-testid`) have been added to `LayersPanel.tsx` and its test.
- ✅ `PropertiesPanel.tsx` has been structurally fixed and is ready for test selector patching.
- ⏭️ **Next step:** Refactor `PropertiesPanel.test.tsx` to use robust selectors, then run all tests to verify correctness.

TODO LIST
- [ ] Refactor `/src/components/panels/__tests__/PropertiesPanel.test.tsx` to use robust selectors (`data-testid`, flexible matcher).
- [ ] Patch other panel/component test files for robust selectors as needed.
- [ ] Run all tests and verify selectors work and all tests pass.
- [ ] Test the application’s critical path end-to-end.
- [ ] Ensure every piece of code is working as intended and error-free.
