# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The FloorPlanner application needs a complete overhaul to implement all Phase-1 features from the floorplanner-features.md specification. This includes creating an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, real-time 3D visualization, social collaboration features, automated measurement tools, simplified export capabilities, effortless revision management, and CAD import functionality. The interface will use floating, repositionable panels with shadcn UI components for a modern, professional appearance.

2. WHEN a user adds comments THEN comment pins SHALL be placed on specific design areas with positioning
3. WHEN a user creates a public preview link THEN sharing SHALL be enabled with configurable comment capability
4. WHEN a user shares on social media THEN Instagram/Facebook integration SHALL be available with branded visuals
5. WHEN collaborators are active THEN user avatars and cursor positions SHALL be visible to all participants
6. WHEN a user posts comments THEN threaded discussions SHALL be supported with replies
7. WHEN a user shares links THEN permission levels SHALL be configurable (view-only, commenting, editing)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user creating precise designs, I want automated measurement tools so that I can ensure accurate dimensions and spacing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user draws walls THEN room dimensions SHALL be auto-calculated and displayed as walls are drawn
2. WHEN a user uses the virtual tape measure THEN accurate spacing checks SHALL be provided between objects
3. WHEN a user places objects with insufficient clearance THEN error alerts SHALL warn about issues ("Door won't open!")
4. WHEN a user views measurements THEN units SHALL be customizable (metric/imperial) with proper formatting
5. WHEN a user calculates areas THEN total room areas SHALL be automatically computed and displayed
6. WHEN a user measures distances THEN interactive measurement tools SHALL provide precise readings
7. WHEN a user checks spacing THEN clearance validation SHALL prevent design conflicts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user completing designs, I want simplified export and presentation tools so that I can easily share and print my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user exports images THEN one-click photorealistic renders SHALL be available with 8K resolution support
2. WHEN a user creates walkthroughs THEN virtual walkthrough videos SHALL be generated with auto-navigated tours
3. WHEN a user exports for contractors THEN printable PDFs SHALL maintain scale accuracy
4. WHEN a user exports content THEN progress indicators SHALL show real-time export status
5. WHEN a user downloads exports THEN multiple format options SHALL be available (PNG, JPG, PDF, MP4)
6. WHEN a user configures exports THEN quality settings SHALL be adjustable (standard, high, 8K)
